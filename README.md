# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository holds the peer graded assignment for week-4, as in the course **Getting and Cleaning Data**, under the **Data Science in R** specialization. It consists of the instructions about the execution of the analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset Analysed

The dataset, that is used for this analysis, is available at the following link: <br />
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files Included in the Repo.

* ```CodeBook.md``` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations > or work that I performed to clean up the data <br />
* ```run_analysis.R``` performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required > as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:  <br />
>   * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>   * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>   * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
>   * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
>   * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* ```UCI HAR Dataset``` directory holds the downloaded dataset (as from the source, provided).

* ```FinalData.txt``` is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.

(A compressed ``` .zip``` file is also included, holding data files)
